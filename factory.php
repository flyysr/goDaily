 *
 * This code uses a factory to create the Automobile object. 
 * There are two possible benefits to building your code this way; the first is that if you need to change, rename, 
 * or replace the Automobile class later on you can do so and you will only have to modify the code in the factory, 
 * instead of every place in your project that uses the Automobile class. 
 * 
 * The second possible benefit is that if creating the object is a complicated job you can do all of the work in the factory, 
 * instead of repeating it every time you want to create a new instance.
 * 
 * Using the factory pattern isnâ€™t always necessary (or wise). 
 * The example code used here is so simple that a factory would simply be adding unneeded complexity. 
 * However if you are making a fairly large or complex project you may save yourself a lot of trouble down the road by using factories.
